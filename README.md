## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://myinnovation.studio)

**My Innovation Studio** is a [PWA](https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas) (Progressive Web Application) platform that solves modern-world educational problems by implementing several gamification techniques in order to boost the performance of students and uplevel the educational process as a whole.

 Some of the techniques we introduce are:
* Achievements, rewards, and badges.
* Leaderboards on a national, regional, and university level.
* Intelligent scoring and leveling system.

We collaborate with universities and educational centers around the world to provide their students with the best educational experience possible in the modern age.

We are commited to protecting the privacy of our users and clients, hence the platform is fully open-source. You can check the `LICENSE` to know more.

* PHP & MySQL for the backend.
* InfinityFree hosting.
* Name.com domain name.
